# Improved_Diverse_Frequent_Item_Set_Mining

## Synopsis
 I have proposed a new algorithm that improves the time complexity of mining diverse frequent item sets from large sized datasets by simultaneously mining diverse item sets and frequent item sets and thus reducing the search space for mining.

## Code Description

To implement my algorithm, I have modified the source code of FP-Growth algorithm present in SPMF library. SPMF is an open-source data mining library written in Java, specialized in pattern mining. 

## Motivation

I am a Data Mining, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing enthusiast, who likes to explore these domains. One such endeavour has been this project, where I have tried to improve the time complexity of diverse frequent item set mining.

## Installation and Running the Code

To run this project, the following is required:
1) JDK
2) IDE- Eclipse, Netbeans, etc
3) Dataset - The above codes can be run on a dataset similar to Mushroom dataset 
4) SPMF Library- The two files present in this repository require the support of files present in SPMF library. These two can be included as jar files in the library or can be run as separate class files.
