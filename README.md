# Improved_Diverse_Frequent_Item_Set_Mining

## Synopsis
 I have proposed a new algorithm that improves the time complexity of mining diverse frequent item sets from large sized datasets by simultaneously mining diverse item sets and frequent item sets and thus reducing the search space for mining.

## Code Description

To implement my algorithm, I have modified the source code of FP-Growth algorithm present in SPMF library. SPMF is an open-source data mining library written in Java, specialized in pattern mining. 

## Motivation

I am Data Mining, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing enthusiast, who likes to explores these domains. One such endeavour has been this project, where I have tried to improve the time complexity of diverse frequent item set mining.

## Installation

To run this project, the following is required:
1) JDK
2) IDE- Eclipse, Netbeans, etc
3) Dataset - The above codes can be run on a dataset similar to Mushroom dataset
